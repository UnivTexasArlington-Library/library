        <p>The following is an excerpt from the The Story of my Life by Helen Keller</p>
        <p>"Even in the days before my teacher came, I used to feel along the square
            stiff boxwood hedges, and, guided by the sense of smell, would find the
            first violets and lilies. There, too, after a fit of temper, I went to
            find comfort and to hide my hot face in the cool leaves and grass."</p>
        <p>Helen Keller said, Self-pity is our worst enemy and if we yield to it,
            we can never do anything good in the world.</p>
        <p>Beth received 1st place in the 9th grade science competition.</p>
        <p>The chemical notation for water is H2O.</p>
