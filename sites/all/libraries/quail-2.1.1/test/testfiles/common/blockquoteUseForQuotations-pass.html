        <p>The following is an excerpt from the <cite>The Story of my Life</cite> by
            Helen Keller</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>Even in the days before my teacher came, I used to feel along the square
                stiff boxwood hedges, and, guided by the sense of smell, would find the
                first violets and lilies. There, too, after a fit of temper, I went to
                find comfort and to hide my hot face in the cool leaves and grass.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Helen Keller said, <q>Self-pity is our worst enemy and if we yield to it, 
we can never do anything good in the world.</q>
