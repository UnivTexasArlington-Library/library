# Siteimprove Plugin


## Introduction

The Siteimprove plugin bridges the gap between WordPress and the Siteimprove Intelligence Platform. You are now able to put your Siteimprove results to use where they are most valuable – during your content creation and editing process. With analytics and content insights always at hand, contributors can test, fix, and optimize their work continuously . Once the detected issues have been assessed, you can directly re-recheck the relevant page and see if further actions are needed. Delivering a superior digital experience has never been more efficient and convenient.
